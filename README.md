I used the same exact code written in the different styles, the three will have the same effect. Class yo is made with SCCS, class tu is made with LESS and class vous is made with CSS. <br />
forum2.html: main html file <br />
forum2c.css: css file which will affect the h1 and h2 of class vous in the html doc <br />
forum2s.scss: sass code which will affect the h1 and h2 of class yo in the html <br />
forum2s.css: the sass file compiled into a css file for the brwoser to be able to read it <br />
forum2l.less: less file which will affect the h1 and h2 of class tu in the html <br />
forum2l.less: the less file compiled into a css file for the browser to be able to be able to read it <br />

here is the live link to see the result: <br />
